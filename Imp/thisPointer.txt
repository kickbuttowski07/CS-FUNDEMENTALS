In C++, 'this' pointer is an implicit pointer available inside all NON-STATIC member function.
Not present in static member functions since 
It always points to the current object that called the function. 
This pointer is internally used by methods to access the other members.
For programmers, it is mainly used to resolve naming conflicts (between parameters and class variables) and for method chaining (returning the same object).
In a class X, "this" has type X* (or const X* in const functions), is unavailable in static functions, and can be used as *this to return the whole current object.
Risky operations like delete this; are possible and generally should be avoided.



1. Resolve name conflicts

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Class demonstrating use of 'this' pointer
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;

public:

    // Constructor with parameters having the same name
    Student(string name, int age) {
        
        // 'this' is used to distinguish between class members and constructor parameters
        this->name = name;
        this->age = age;
    }

    // Member function using 'this'
    void introduce() {
        cout << "Hi, I am " << this->name
             << " and I am " << this->age << " years old." << endl;
    }

    // Returning current object using 'this'
    Student& olderBy(int years) {
        this->age += years;  
        return *this;        
    }
};

int main() {

    Student s("Alice", 20);

    // Display initial introduction
    s.introduce();

    // Increase age and reintroduce
    s.olderBy(2).introduce();

    return 0;
}

2.Chain function calls on single object
search about this
