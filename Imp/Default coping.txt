by using assigning operator
let say, A is a class object of class Rakhi,
we can do : Rakhi B = A; (all the corresponding attributes are copied)(defaultly)
            OR by Rakhi B {A};

Copy of class object = copy of each member of that class.

This is know as OPERATOR OVERLOADING.
Assignment operator overloading is binary operator overloading.
Overloading assignment operator in C++ copies all values of one object to another object.
**** Only a non-static member function should be used to overload the assignment operator.

In C++, the compiler automatically provides a default assignment operator for classes. 
This operator performs a SHALLOW COPY of each member of the class from one object to another. 
This means that if we don't explicitly overload the assignment operator, the compiler will still allow us to assign one object to another using the assignment operator (=), and it won't generate an error.
