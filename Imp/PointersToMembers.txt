POINTER TO MEMBERS:
It is possible to take the address of a member of a class and assign it to a pointer.
The address of a member can be obtained by applying the operator & to a "fully qualified" class member name.
class member pointer can be declared using the operator "::*" with class name.

class A {
    private:
        int m;
    public:
        void show();
};

int A::* ip = & A::m; (defination)

A::* -> pointer to the member of class A.
&A::m -> address of the member of class A.

int *ip = &m; -> invalid;
since m is not simply int data type
****It has meaning only when it is associated with class to which it is belongs to.

LET consider:
main() {
    A a;
    cout << a.(*ip) << endl; (ip is pointer to the member m, of class A);
    cout << a.m << endl; // same as above

    
}
