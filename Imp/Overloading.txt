OPERATOR OVERLOADING:

we can overload all C++ operators except:
1. Class member operators (., .*)
2. Scope resolutions (::)
3. size operator (sizeof)
4. Conditional operator (?:)




METHOD OVERLOADING:
In C++, method overloading refers to defining multiple functions within the same class with the same name but different parameter lists.
This is a form of compile-time polymorphism.
Method overloading allows a class to have more than one function with the same name but differing in:

1.Number of parameters
2.Type of parameters
3.Order of parameters

Working:
The compiler determines at compile time which method to call based on:

Number of arguments
Types of arguments
Order of arguments

Keep in mind that return type alone cannot differentiate overloaded methods

void display(int a = 0);

// Ambiguous â€” both match a call like display();
void display();
